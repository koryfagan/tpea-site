      When a serious incident occurs, explanation no longer carries weight.
      Regulators assess governance structure, escalation logic, and evidentiary standing as they existed before the event.
      This Stress Test examines whether your documented system survives that reading.

        Most SME safety frameworks satisfy documentation requirements.
