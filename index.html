          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            The Private Equity Advantage is a decision discipline.
          </p>
        </header>

        <p>It applies institutional investment logic to operating businesses.</p>

        <p>
          Most companies do not fail from lack of ambition. They fail from untested assumptions embedded in daily workflow — pricing tolerated without scrutiny, risk accepted without modelling, dependency unmeasured, governance informal. Most businesses are not fragile because they lack effort. They are fragile because they lack friction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Private equity firms approach businesses differently. They assume error. They test cash conversion. They examine contractual leverage. They quantify operational fragility. They underwrite downside before underwriting growth.
        </p>

        <p>Operating managers optimise within the system they know. Investors interrogate the system itself.</p>

        <p>TPEA translates that posture into structured operating stress tests.</p>

        <p>
          Each Stress Test isolates a core dimension of enterprise durability — capital efficiency, revenue quality, contractual exposure, dependency risk, operational concentration, and governance discipline. The objective is not advice. It is visibility.
        </p>

        <p>Visibility changes behaviour.</p>

        <p>
          When constraints are made explicit, allocation improves.<br />
          When fragility is surfaced, tolerance narrows.<br />
          When decision surfaces are clarified, discipline compounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Institutional scrutiny eventually arrives — through capital, competitors, regulators, or crisis. TPEA applies it deliberately, in advance.
        </p>

        <p>
          TPEA was founded by Kory Fagan, a private equity investor and operator with more than 25 years’ experience in the New Zealand mid-market, including as a founding partner of NZ Equity Partners. Over that period, he observed that enterprise risk is typically absorbed quietly long before it is recognised formally — and that valuation outcomes are determined by the discipline applied years earlier.
        </p>

        <p>
          His work centres on capital allocation, governance architecture, and downside underwriting — the mechanics that determine durability before growth narratives are written.
        </p>

        <p>
          TPEA does not provide strategy decks.<br />
          It does not offer transformation programs.<br />
          It does not optimise for expansion narratives.
        </p>

        <p>It imposes structured review.</p>

        <p>
          The output is a clearer understanding of how a business would perform under institutional scrutiny — before capital, before crisis, before negotiation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Constraint precedes scale.<br />
          Durability precedes valuation.<br />
          Discipline precedes advantage.
