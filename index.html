        <p>
          The Private Equity Advantage applies institutional investment logic to operating businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most companies do not fail from lack of ambition. They fail from untested assumptions embedded in daily operations — pricing never stress-tested, risk accepted without modelling, key dependencies unmeasured, governance left informal. Fragility does not come from lack of effort. It comes from nothing forcing the business to prove it is durable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Private equity investors assume error. They test cash conversion. They examine contractual leverage. They quantify operational fragility. They underwrite downside before they underwrite growth. Operators optimise within the system they know. Investors interrogate the system itself. TPEA translates that investor posture into structured stress tests for operating businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each Stress Test isolates a single dimension of enterprise durability — capital efficiency, revenue quality, contractual exposure, dependency risk, operational concentration, governance discipline — and reads it as an external authority would. The objective is not advice. It is clarity on how the business withstands scrutiny not yet faced.
        </p>

        <p>
          Institutional scrutiny always arrives — through capital, competitors, regulators, or crisis. TPEA applies it deliberately, in advance, on your terms.
        </p>

        <header class="section__header" style="margin-top:3rem;">
          <h3>Founder</h3>
        </header>

        <p>
          TPEA was founded by Kory Fagan — a private equity investor and operator with more than 25 years in the New Zealand mid-market, including as a founding partner of NZ Equity Partners. Across that period, one pattern recurred: enterprise risk accumulates quietly long before it is recognised formally, and valuation outcomes are determined by discipline applied years before anyone runs a number.
        </p>

        <p>
          His work centres on capital allocation, governance architecture, and downside underwriting — the mechanics that determine durability before growth narratives are written.
        </p>

        <header class="section__header" style="margin-top:3rem;">
          <h3>What TPEA Is Not</h3>
        </header>

        <p>
          TPEA does not provide strategy decks. It does not run transformation programs. It does not build expansion narratives. It imposes structured review so you understand how the business reads under institutional scrutiny before capital arrives, before crisis hits, before negotiation begins.
        </p>

        <p>
          Constraint precedes scale. Durability precedes valuation. Discipline precedes advantage.
